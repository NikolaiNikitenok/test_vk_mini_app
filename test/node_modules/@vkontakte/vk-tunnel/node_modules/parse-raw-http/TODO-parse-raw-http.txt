### I want to automatically parse formdata/JSON/[YAML](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/1/28/Rails-3-0-20-and-2-3-16-have-been-released/)!

res.rawHeadData     // Buffer: through the first CRLFCRLF
res.rawBodyData     // Buffer: everything after that

<!-- // TODO: res.bodyText() -->

assert and handle: decodeContentEncoding, decodeTransferEncoding
